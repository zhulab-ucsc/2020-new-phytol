# Figure 1 design
Forest biomass-age growth curves

## Goals

To show additive vs. hierarchical methods to model biomass recovery with
stand age, with the impact from environmental change. Motivated by
Anderson-Teixeira et al. (2013) but don’t make it too similar. Show
innovation!

## Monod growth function

Panel a shows additive, and panel b shows hierarchical.

## Fit Monod model to ForC data

Fit a Monod model to all ForC simplified data, mu = 929.2607, k = 1008.9830.

## Compare growth models
This may go beyond the scope of this paper, but it would be interesting to compare Monod model with commonly used biomass ~ log(stand age + 1) model. FIA data shows Monod model has much lower AIC than log model (Zhu et al. 2018 supplement).
